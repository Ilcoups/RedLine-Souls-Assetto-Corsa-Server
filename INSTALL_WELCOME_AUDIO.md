# RedLine Souls - Welcome Audio Installation

## For Players: How to Get the Welcome Sound

The server has a custom welcome audio that plays when you join, but **you need to install it manually** on your PC.

### Installation Steps:

1. **Download the audio file:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Ilcoups/RedLine-Souls-Assetto-Corsa-Server
   - Navigate to: `content/sfx/RedLineSoulsIntro.ogg`
   - Download the file

2. **Install to your AC folder:**
   ```
   Copy RedLineSoulsIntro.ogg to:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\content\sfx\
   ```
   (Create the `sfx` folder if it doesn't exist)

3. **Join the server** - Audio will now play!

### Why Manual Installation?

AC multiplayer servers **cannot force audio downloads** to clients. The [AUDIO] tag only works with files you already have locally. This is a security feature to prevent servers from playing arbitrary sounds on your computer.

### File Details:
- Size: ~187 KB
- Format: OGG (CSP compatible)
- Plays: 5 seconds after joining
