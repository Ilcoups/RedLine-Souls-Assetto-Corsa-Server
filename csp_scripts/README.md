# CSP Lua Chat Filter

This is a **client-side** CSP Lua script that filters out AI traffic messages from chat.

## Installation (For Players):

1. Download `traffic_chat_filter.lua`
2. Copy to: `Documents/Assetto Corsa/cfg/lua/online/`
3. Restart Assetto Corsa
4. Join the server - traffic messages will be hidden!

## What it does:
- ✅ Hides "Traffic X has joined"
- ✅ Hides "Traffic X has disconnected"  
- ✅ Hides "Traffic X has left"
- ✅ Shows all player messages
- ✅ Shows all other chat

## Important Notes:

⚠️ **This is CLIENT-SIDE** - Each player needs to install it themselves
⚠️ **Requires CSP** - Won't work without Custom Shaders Patch
⚠️ **Not server-side** - Server can't force clients to use it

## Alternative: Server-Side Forcing

Unfortunately, CSP Lua scripts **cannot be forced by the server** for chat filtering.
The best server-side solution is the configuration changes already made to reduce AI churn.

## For Server Admins:

You can share this script with your players via Discord/website so they can install it if they want cleaner chat!
