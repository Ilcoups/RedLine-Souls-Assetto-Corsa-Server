- Ensure players are near the track spline (not far off-road)

### Weather Not Changing
- Verify RandomWeatherPlugin is listed in `EnablePlugins` section
- Check logs for "Random weather transitioning to..." messages
- Ensure WeatherFX is enabled

### Server Won't Start
- Check `logs/server_console.log` for errors
- Verify YAML syntax in `extra_cfg.yml` (indentation matters!)
