---

## ⚠️ What's NOT Working

❌ **Automatic weather cycling** - Plugins failed to load
❌ **RandomWeatherPlugin** - Configuration error
❌ **TimeDilationPlugin** - Configuration error

**Current behavior:** Weather stays on WEATHER_0 (Clear) by default

---

## 🎮 How to Change Weather

### Option 1: In-Game Admin Commands (Recommended)

1. Join server as admin (set password in `server_cfg.ini`)
2. Open chat and type:
   - `/w 0` or `/weather 0` = Clear
   - `/w 1` or `/weather 1` = Cloudy
   - `/w 2` or `/weather 2` = Partly Cloudy
   - `/w 3` or `/weather 3` = Fog

### Option 2: Player Voting

Players can vote for weather changes using CSP features (if enabled).

### Option 3: Enable VotingWeatherPlugin

1. Edit `cfg/extra_cfg.yml`:
   ```yaml
   EnablePlugins:
     - VotingWeatherPlugin
   ```

2. Restart server
3. Players can vote for weather in-game

## 🔧 Why Plugins Don't Work

The RandomWeatherPlugin and TimeDilationPlugin require specific configuration that isn't documented.
The plugins are installed but need proper setup files.

### Possible Solutions:

1. **Use manual admin commands** (easiest)
2. **Enable VotingWeatherPlugin** (players choose)
3. **Wait for plugin documentation** from AssettoServer
4. **Use default weather** (clear sky)

## 📊 Current Server Setup

**Time System:**
- ✅ Real Tokyo time (Asia/Tokyo)
- ✅ Currently set to 10:00 AM start
- ❌ Time multiplier not active (plugins disabled)
- Result: Time passes normally (1:1 real-time)

**Weather System:**
- ✅ 4 weather types available
- ✅ WeatherFX smooth transitions
- ❌ No automatic cycling
- Result: Weather stays on Clear unless manually changed

---

## 💡 Recommended Approach

**For Now:**
1. Use **WEATHER_0 (Clear)** as default ✅
2. **Change manually** when you want variety
3. Or enable **VotingWeatherPlugin** for player choice

**Future:**
- Check AssettoServer Discord for plugin configs
- Update plugins when documentation available
- Or create custom plugin with .NET SDK (we have it installed!)

---

## 🎯 Quick Reference

**Server is working with:**
✅ Dynamic AI traffic (200 cars max)
✅ Multiple weather types (manual change)
✅ Real Tokyo timezone
✅ Day/night cycles
✅ WeatherFX smooth transitions

**Not working:**
❌ Automatic weather cycling (use manual/voting instead)

**Bottom line:** Server is fully functional, just needs manual weather changes!
