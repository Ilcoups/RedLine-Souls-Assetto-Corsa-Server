## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES FOUND

### 1. Empty Admin File ⚠️
**File**: /home/acserver/server/admins.txt  
**Status**: File exists but is EMPTY  
**Impact**: You can't use admin commands in-game  
**Fix**:
```bash
# Add your Steam ID to admins.txt
echo "76561199185532445" >> /home/acserver/server/admins.txt
```

### 2. HTTP Errors in Logs ⚠️
**Error**: `NullReferenceException` in `HttpController.GetDetails()`  
**Location**: Line 124 of HttpController.cs  
**Impact**: Minor - doesn't affect gameplay  
**Details**: HTTP API endpoint throwing errors (probably Content Manager server info requests)  
**Status**: AssettoServer bug, not your config issue  
**Action**: Can ignore - doesn't affect actual gameplay or connections

## 🟢 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Priority 1: Add Your Steam ID
Your admins.txt file is empty! Add your Steam ID so you can use admin commands:

```bash
# Get your Steam ID from: https://steamid.io/
# Then add it to admins.txt
echo "YOUR_STEAM_ID_HERE" >> /home/acserver/server/admins.txt
```

**Your Steam ID appears to be**: 76561199185532445 (player "il" from logs)

### Priority 2: Test External Connectivity
While ports are listening locally, test from external network:

- Use: https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
- Test port: 9600
- IP: 188.245.183.146

### Priority 3: Monitor Next Connection
Run the connection monitor to see detailed disconnect reasons:

```bash
./monitor_connections.sh
```

This will show color-coded connection events in real-time.
