### Player Readiness Check (Windows)

Share this one-liner so players can verify their PC/network before joining:

```
& { $f = Join-Path $env:TEMP ("csr_"+([guid]::NewGuid().ToString())+".ps1"); Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ilcoups/RedLine-Souls-Assetto-Corsa-Server/main/scripts/Check-ServerReadiness.ps1' -OutFile $f; & powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $f -ServerHost '188.245.183.146' -TcpPorts 9600 -UdpPorts 9600; Remove-Item -Force $f }
```

It prints a PASS/FAIL summary and creates a support bundle zip to share with the admin.

## ⚙️ Customization

### Adjust Traffic Density

AiParams:
  AiPerPlayerTargetCount: 12  # Cars per player
  MaxAiTargetCount: 200       # Total AI limit
```

### Change Weather Duration

Edit `cfg/extra_cfg.yml`:

```yaml
RandomWeatherPlugin:
  MinWeatherDurationMinutes: 30
  MaxWeatherDurationMinutes: 60
```

### Modify Time Speed

Edit `cfg/server_cfg.ini`:

```ini
TIME_MULT=8  # 1x = real-time, 8x = fast day/night
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### AI Traffic Not Spawning

- Check `MaxPlayerDistanceToAiSplineMeters` is set to 150+ in `extra_cfg.yml`.
- Ensure players are near the track spline (not far off-road).

### Weather Not Changing

- Verify RandomWeatherPlugin is listed in `EnablePlugins` section.
- Check logs for "Random weather transitioning to..." messages.
- Ensure WeatherFX is enabled.

### Server Won't Start

- Check `logs/server_console.log` for errors.
- Verify YAML syntax in `extra_cfg.yml` (indentation matters!).
- Ensure all required content is installed.
