# Server Optimizations Applied - October 13, 2025

## Summary
All recommended optimizations have been successfully implemented to improve server performance, AI behavior, and player experience.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ SmoothCamber: true (AI Traffic Quality)
**File**: `cfg/extra_cfg.yml` line 164
**Changed**: `false` → `true`
**Impact**: 
- AI cars now smoothly transition through banked curves on elevated highways
- More realistic car behavior on Shuto Revival Project's complex road network
- Better visual quality, eliminates "jerky" movements on curved roads

### 2. ✅ TIME_OF_DAY_MULT: 8 (Time Multiplier Fix)
**File**: `cfg/server_cfg.ini` line 137
**Changed**: `1` → `8`
**Impact**:
- Properly enables 8x time multiplier for the server
- Makes hourly traffic density system work correctly
- Full day/night cycle completes in ~3 hours real-time
- Sunrise/sunset happen more frequently for better visual variety

### 3. ✅ MaxPlayerCount: 40 (AI Traffic Guarantee)
**File**: `cfg/extra_cfg.yml` line 145
**Status**: Already configured correctly
**Impact**:
- Server stops accepting players at 40 (out of 53 total slots)
- Guarantees minimum 13 slots always available for AI traffic
- Prevents server from being completely filled by human players
- Ensures consistent traffic density even during peak hours

### 4. ✅ PlayerLoadingTimeoutMinutes: 5 (Connection Efficiency)
**File**: `cfg/extra_cfg.yml` line 73
**Changed**: `15` → `5`
**Impact**:
- Reduced loading screen timeout from 15 to 5 minutes
- Prevents slow/AFK players from blocking server slots during connection
- 5 minutes is standard for freeroam servers
- Faster slot turnover for active players

### 5. ✅ PlayerChecksumTimeoutSeconds: 40 (Validation Speed)
**File**: `cfg/extra_cfg.yml` line 75
**Changed**: `60` → `40`
**Impact**:
- Faster car/track checksum validation timeout
- Quicker detection of connection problems
- Standard recommended value (40 seconds)
- Reduces time spent waiting on failed connections

## Technical Benefits

### Performance
- **Faster player onboarding**: Reduced timeouts mean quicker slot recycling
- **Better resource allocation**: More predictable AI spawning with guaranteed slots
- **Network efficiency**: Maintained CustomUpdate for optimal position syncing

### AI Traffic Quality
- **Smoother visuals**: Camber smoothing eliminates visual artifacts on curves
- **Realistic behavior**: AI cars bank naturally through Shuto's elevated highways
- **Time-based density**: 8x multiplier enables proper hourly traffic variation

### Player Experience
- **Consistent traffic**: MaxPlayerCount ensures AI always present
- **Faster joins**: Reduced timeouts mean less waiting
- **Beautiful visuals**: Smooth AI + fast day/night cycles = better atmosphere

## Configuration Summary

### Extra Config (extra_cfg.yml)
```yaml
PlayerLoadingTimeoutMinutes: 5        # Was: 15
PlayerChecksumTimeoutSeconds: 40      # Was: 60
MaxPlayerCount: 40                    # Already set
SmoothCamber: true                    # Was: false
HourlyTrafficDensity: [0.5, 0.5, ...] # Already configured
```

### Server Config (server_cfg.ini)
```ini
TIME_OF_DAY_MULT=8                    # Was: 1
```

## Server Status
- **Applied**: October 13, 2025 at 11:03 UTC
- **Server PID**: 103240
- **Status**: ✅ Running successfully
- **Lobby**: Registered and visible
- **Weather**: Random system active (ScatteredClouds)

---

## Next Steps

### Monitor These Metrics:
1. **AI smoothness** - Watch for improved car behavior on curves
2. **Player count** - Verify soft limit (40) works correctly
3. **Connection times** - Should be faster with reduced timeouts
4. **Traffic density** - Hourly variation should now work properly

### Future Considerations:
- Monitor server logs for any timeout-related kicks
- Adjust MaxPlayerCount if you want different AI density
- Consider seasonal time multiplier changes (longer days in summer)
