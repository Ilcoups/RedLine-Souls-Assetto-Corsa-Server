# 🌤️ Automatic Random Weather System - WORKING!

## ✅ System Status: ACTIVE

Your server now has **automatic random weather changes**!

## 📊 How It Works

### Automatic Weather Cycling:
- **Every 20-40 minutes**: Weather changes automatically
- **2-5 minute smooth transitions**: CSP WeatherFX handles beautiful transitions
- **Weighted random selection**: More realistic weather appears more often
- **Works 24/7**: Even when nobody is on the server!

- **~21% Few Clouds** - Still sunny
- **~18% Scattered Clouds** - Nice variety
- **~14% Broken Clouds** - Moody

## 🔧 Manual Override

**Players/Admins can still force weather:**
```
/weather 0  →  Force change to Clear
/w 0        →  Same thing (shorter)
```

This will change weather immediately and reset the random cycle.

## ⚙️ Customization

Want to adjust? Edit `cfg/extra_cfg.yml`:

### Make fog more common:
```yaml
Fog: 2.0  # Was 0.5
```

### Longer weather duration:
```yaml
MinWeatherDurationMinutes: 30
MaxWeatherDurationMinutes: 60
```

### Faster transitions:
```yaml
MinTransitionDurationSeconds: 60
MaxTransitionDurationSeconds: 180
```

Then restart server: `./stop_server.sh && ./start_server.sh`

---

## 📋 Server Logs

You'll see messages like:
```
[INF] Random weather transitioning to "Clear", 
      transition duration 180 seconds, 
      weather duration 25 minutes
```

This tells you:
- Next weather: Clear
- Transition time: 3 minutes
- How long it'll last: 25 minutes
